This folder is for image analysis, particularly
of objects in an image and their shapes, areas, and changes over time.

This will be expanded to apply to images of ceramic pellets being sintered
in real-time while in the IR furnace.

By monitoring the volume change of parts through image analysis,
we can determine when ceramics have completed densification
and use that to adjust the furnace parameters.
