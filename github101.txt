Using GitHub from the command line interface (CLI) is a more straightforward than
using either the desktop app or the website upload functionality.
I'm by NO MEANS a GitHub expert, but here's what I've picked up in my adventures.

GitHub is organized into repositories, which are a place to organize code
(and other things) into distinct projects. This repo is "HTCeramics".
http://github.com/JairyJicama/HTCeramics
The general form for github urls is just github.com/username/repository
so if you know both of those things, you don't need to open your browser
to figure out the url.

If you're ever wondering how to do something, try docs.github.com

# Setting up a local repository.
# Initialize new repository
If you want to create a NEW repo by initializing it on your machine,
set up a new folder, with the planned name of the repo, and use
  $ git init
You'll also want to add a readme, a .gitignore file, and potentially information
about licensing, etc. If that's what you're up for, Google is a better resource
than I am.

If you have files already created, and you're just trying to start a new repo,
go to that folder, and also use
  $ git init
  $ git add .
This initializes the repo and adds *all* files. See above note about Google.

# Connecting a local folder to an existing repository
This was the whole reason I made this section, so here we go.
First, change your working directory to the local file you'd like to use
as a home for the repo. On Windows, this might look something like...
  $ cd .\HTCeramics
Then, initialize the local file as a Git repo:
  $ git init
Add anything you have to add... and make your first commit.
  $ git add .
  $ git commit -m "First commit"
Then the fun part - telling your local directory to pull from a remote url.
  $ git remote add origin http://github.com/JairyJicama/HTCeramics
  $ git remote -v  #to verify

# Using Git to work on things!
Every morning, I wake up, change my working directory, and
  $ git pull
This will give you an overview of additions and removals that anyone else has
pushed since the last time you made your branch current. Sometimes you're
already up to date, sometimes not.
When you're done with a file for the time being, have tested it to the extent
that you're willing, feel free to make a commit.
Each push can have multiple commits, which themselves can have multiple changes.
Generally, I commit and push once, near the end of the day. You do you.
  $ git commit -m "your commit comment, which can be seen by everyone that can
                    see the repo"
  $ git push -u origin master
Congrats! You've pushed all of your work to the central repo. Now others can
pull that information to merge into their local branches, and see your work.

# Git branches common problems (to be updated as needed)
To set up a local copy of a branch that stays tracked, first make sure that no
local branches already exist with that name. In older versions of Git, there
may be a better way to do this, but as of now, the cleanest command:
  $ git checkout --track <remote-branch>
For example,
  $ git checkout --track remotes/origin/problem_solving
This will automagically create a local copy of the branch named accordingly, and
switch you over to it immediately. A a reminder, you can always check existing
branches and your current branch with
  $ git branch -a

* Git announced an intent to make some terminology changes this year, so when you
  create a new repository or work on an existing one that was made after these
  changes, while "master" might still work, you'll likely want to use "main" or
  "primary" or whatever they settle on. When they change, you'll be able to find
  information online.


Feel free to ask for other information if you need it. But also, Google is
your best friend. The chances that I don't just google it when you ask me
are pretty slim... but I'm happy to add to this as needed.
