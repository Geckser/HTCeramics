This github repo is for short-term storage of python projects for any undergrads working for Geoff Brennecka.
This repository is open to the current students at CSM plus the executive high school students from JeffCo.
If you have questions about using git or GitHub, I highly recommend at least reading chapter 2 of the Pro Git book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
If you have questions about anything else, feel free to ask in the group chat or email one of the CSM students directly.
