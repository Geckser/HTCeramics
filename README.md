This github repo is for short-term storage of python projects for any undergrads working for Geoff Brennecka.
This repository is open to the current students at CSM plus the executive high school students from JeffCo.
If you have questions about using git or GitHub, I highly recommend at least reading chapter 2 of the Pro Git book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).
If you have questions about anything else, feel free to ask in the group chat or email one of the CSM students directly.
New to Python? Learn it the Hard Way. Poke around on Slack for a current link to Python 3 the Hard Way (by Zed Shaw). Get through at least excercise 20 to develop some familiarity with the basic operations of Python. Or don't, I'm not a README, not a cop.

Most of the code here is python with modules from anaconda [http://anaconda.org/]. If you have base conda installed, most of the modules will exist on your machine,
like numPy, matplotlib, and others. 
A few modules (generally in testing) may need to be installed separately.
I suggest doing any additional installations in a separate *environment*, which can be set up with
  $ conda create --name <Name>
and activated with
  $ conda activate <Name>
It's not necessary, but it's nice to keep a clean workspace, and can help avoid conflicts if you start tinkering with extra modules (totally not speaking from experience). 

If you already have an IDE that you're familiar with, cool. It doesn't matter what you use, though we have seen some 
funky header artifacts from PyCharm. If you're new to all of this, I recommend Atom. It's free, has a ton of available plugins, 
is built with GitHub integration, and looks nice, while being fairly lightweight.
