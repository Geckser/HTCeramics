I'm sending you a couple data files that are pretty good examples of Raman signals from some samples of mine. The peaks in this data overlap quite a bit and may pose you quite a challenge. The image below gives you a preview of what they look like, even though it doesn't include the actual data that's attached. Each characteristic peak is labelled in the diagram, but as you can see, there's at least one extra that isn't labelled at ~750cm-1 and there's others that are so overlapping that even the literature doesn't try to deconvolute them -- E(TO5) & E(TO6). The peak at 0cm-1 can be ignored.
