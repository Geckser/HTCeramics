The .gfrm 's are image files directly taken by a 2D detector. The .raw files have been integrated into column data. In this sample, I scanned ~24 discrete points on my sample, and we did 10 samples, so there were 245 scans. We have been programmatically plotting the data, but doing all the analysis by hand/eyeballing it. I attached just one frame and just one scan so that it doesn't get overwhelming, but that is why it's named _031.
